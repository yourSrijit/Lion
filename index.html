    <h1>The Lion</h1>
    <br>
    <div class="para">
        <p> The lion is a wild animal. The jungle is its natural habitat. It is called “the King of the Jungle”
            because of
            its massive size and raw power. It has a strong build, four legs, a large head with mane (in males), a
            tail and
            two glowing eyes which make it look ferocious. The lion is famous for its roar and hunting ability. It
            lives in
            a ‘pride.’ The details on the majestic animal are discussed in this lion essay.


            As well as being known as the king of the jungle, the lion is also the world's most dangerous animal. He
            is the
            best hunter in the forest. His biological name is Panthera leo, as he is very large and powerful.
